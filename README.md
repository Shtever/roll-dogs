### A basic dice roller for tabletop games. I've been spoiled by JQuery, so this was a project built with pure Javascript<hr>

#### Added BG image of my brother.

#### Currently the standard dice are functional:
 - d4
 - d6
 - d8
 - d10
 - d12
 - d20
 - d100

 ### UPCOMING
 - Option to input unconventional Dice e.g. if you wanted to roll a 5 x d17, etc.
 - Visuals? Maybe.
 - More Styling
